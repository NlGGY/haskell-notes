Notes on learning haskell

## General
* [Good haskell code to read](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6398996/good-haskell-source-to-read-and-learn-from)
* [ResourceT Overview](http://www.yesodweb.com/blog/2013/03/resourcet-overview)
> ResourceT is a monad transformer which creates a region of code where you can safely allocate resources.

## Testing
[HSpec](http://hspec.github.io/) is the only testing framework I have used. You can still use [HUnit](http://hunit.sourceforge.net/) and [QuickCheck2](http://www.haskell.org/haskellwiki/Introduction_to_QuickCheck2), but it is wrapped with some nice bdd functions. Here is an example from the HSpec site to demonstrate how it looks.
```haskell
-- file Spec.hs
import Test.Hspec
import Test.QuickCheck
import Control.Exception (evaluate)

main :: IO ()
main = hspec $ do
  describe "Prelude.head" $ do
    it "returns the first element of a list" $ do
      head [23 ..] `shouldBe` (23 :: Int)

    it "returns the first element of an *arbitrary* list" $
      property $ \x xs -> head (x:xs) == (x :: Int)

    it "throws an exception if used with an empty list" $ do
      evaluate (head []) `shouldThrow` anyException
```
It is easy to use it with cabal. Make a directory `test`, create a file `test/Spec.hs` and add a section in your `.cabal` file that looks like:
```cabal
test-suite spec
  type:           exitcode-stdio-1.0
  hs-source-dirs: test
  main-is:        Spec.hs
  build-depends:  base >=4.7, hspec
```
and then run with `cabal test`.

## Resources
Each resource listed may have a link to code/notes I may have written.
### Monads
* [Trival Monad](http://blog.sigfpe.com/2007/04/trivial-monad.html) by Dan Piponi
  - Good introduction to the intuition behind monads. Should understand types, and the basics behind type classes.
  - [Notes](trivial-monad/README.md)

## Books
* [Write Yourself a Scheme in 48 Hours](http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Write_Yourself_a_Scheme_in_48_Hours) - End up writing a subset of a R5RS Scheme interpreter. An excellent read after some experience in haskell (such as LYAH).
> Most Haskell tutorials on the web use a style of teaching akin to language reference manuals. They show you the syntax of the language, a few language constructs, then tell you to create a few simple functions at the interactive prompt. The "hard stuff" of how to write a functioning, useful program is left to the end, or omitted entirely.

## Courses
* [Constructive Logic](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~fp/courses/15317-f00/)

> "This multidisciplinary junior/senior-level course is designed to provide a thorough introduction to modern constructive logic, its roots in philosophy, its numerous applications in computer science, and its mathematical properties. Some of the topics to be covered are intuitionistic logic, inductive definitions, functional programming, type theory, realizability, connections between classical and constructive logic, decidable classes, temporal logic, model checking."

* [Homotopy Type Theory](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~rwh/courses/hott/) from Robert Harper at CMU

* [Programming Language Theory](http://www.cs.princeton.edu/~dpw/cos441-11/) from David Walker of Princeton

> This advanced course is for graduate students and advanced undergraduates with a keen interest in how to design, describe and reason about programming languages. The only requirement for the course is some mathematical maturity including, for instance, familiarity with proof techniques such as induction.

> Topics include: Theory and design of programming languages. How languages support abstraction, modularity and concurrency through functional programming and other mechanisms. Operational semantics of programming languages.  Denotational semantics of programming languages.  Type systems including polymorphism and subtyping.  The relation between programming languages and logic.

## Category Theory

### [Edward Kmett's answer on quora](http://www.quora.com/Category-Theory/What-is-the-best-textbook-for-Category-theory)
Good starting point on what to read. It is pasted here to avoid going to quora.
> If you are starting from zero and have little background with mathematics as a whole then [Conceptual Mathematics: A First Introduction to Categories by Lawvere and Schanuel](http://www.amazon.com/Conceptual-Mathematics-First-Introduction-Categories/dp/052171916X) is probably the best starting point. It doesn't go deep or far, but it does supply you with a lot of drill for the material it does cover, which is quite rare for a category theory textbook!

> If you have a lot of "mathematical maturity" probably the most dense book on the topic is [Categories for the Working Mathematician by Saunders Mac Lane](http://www.amazon.com/Categories-Working-Mathematician-Graduate-Mathematics/dp/0387984038) [PDF](http://www.maths.ed.ac.uk/~aar/papers/maclanecat.pdf). I personally bounced off this book a half-dozen times trying to work through it, but in the end was able to make it through. The journey is tough, but the reward at the end is worth it. It is a very comprehensive summary of 1-category theory, and nicely ties up the core ideas at that level. The last chapter is enough of an introduction to 2-category theory that you can find your way through much of nLab.

> I also highly recommend watching the [Catsters videos on youtube](https://www.youtube.com/user/TheCatsters). Eugenia Cheng is a wonderfully enthusiastic and effective speaker, and watching them gives you a much better sense of "how category theory is done" than you get by reading any book. They come in short 10 minute long bite-sized pieces, so you don't need to commit a lot of time at one sitting.

> For _motivating_ category theory I highly recommend going through Baez and Stay's [Physics, Topology, Logic and Computation: A Rosetta Stone](http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/rosetta.pdf). It is "just a summary" but Baez writes amazing summary papers, and it gives you a sense of just how connected mathematics can be when you are working in a category theoretic framework.

> Similarly, John Baez has [An Introduction to n-Categories](http://arxiv.org/abs/q-alg/9705009), which does a good job of motivating the different notions of strict and weak n-categories.

> [Barr and Wells' Toposes, Triples and Theories](http://www.amazon.com/Toposes-Theories-Grundlehren-mathematischen-Wissenschaften/dp/1489900233), uses vocabulary that is a bit dated, but provides a very nice overview of some aspects of category theory that are underserved, such as fibrations, the topological viewpoint on category theory, and Lawvere theories.

> A somewhat odd reference to recommend for category theory, but I'll recommend it anyways, is [Algebra by Serge Lang](http://www.amazon.com/Algebra-Graduate-Texts-Mathematics-Serge/dp/038795385X). Why? One thing that he does very well is supply categorifications and category-theoretic implications of many of the ideas he explores from an algebra perspective. The book is dense, as it is targeted at graduate students, but if you can make it through Mac Lane, then Algebra maintains only a slightly slower pace, for several times as many pages.

> But to actually answer the question: The best single "general purpose" category theory book I can recommend is by Steve Awodey, it is simply titled [Category Theory](http://www.amazon.com/Category-Theory-Oxford-Logic-Guides/dp/0199237182). It is probably the best "all around" category theory book I can think of, in that it makes fewer assumptions about mathematical maturity than Mac Lane, but gets farther than Lawvere and Schanuel. It is really the only one out of all these books and resources I can recommend without equivocating about what level of "mathematical maturity" the reader should have to make progress.
