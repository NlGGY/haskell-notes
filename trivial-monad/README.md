# Trivial Monad

http://blog.sigfpe.com/2007/04/trivial-monad.html

Good article which explains why we would need monads through the use of the data type: `data W x = W x`. See [Identity Monad](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/mtl-1.1.0.2/docs/Control-Monad-Identity.html), which is similar to the trivial monad with a constructor.
